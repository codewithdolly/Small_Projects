                    <summary>What is CSS?</summary>
                    <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and is a simple styling language which allows attaching
                        style
                        to
                        HTML elements. </p>

                <details class="faq">
                    <summary>CSS Reset</summary>
                    <p>All browsers have their own proprietary default style. So, if no CSS rules are used on a webpage,
                        the
                        browser will determine how fonts, padding, and margins appear. By using CSS resets, a developer
                        can
                        override a browser’s style sheet by setting things like margins and paddings to “zero”.
                        Consequently
                        allowing the developer to use her or his own specifications.</p>

                    <summary>Is CSS save time?</summary>
                    <p>You can write CSS once and then reuse the same sheet in multiple HTML pages. You can define a
                        style
                        for
                        each HTML element and apply it to as many Web pages as you want.</p>

                    <summary>Global web standards</summary>
                    <p>Now HTML attributes are being deprecated and it is being recommended to use CSS. So it's a good
                        idea
                        to
                        start using CSS in all the HTML pages to make them compatible with future browsers.</p>

                    <p>Cascading sheet not only simplifies website development, but also simplifies the maintenance as a
                        change
                        of one line of code affects the whole web site and maintenance time.</p>

                        Text
                        Effects, 2D/3D Transformations, Animations, Multiple Column Layout, and User Interface.</p>
